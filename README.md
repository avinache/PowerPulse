Machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data

In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.
From this project we provide **actionable insights** into energy usage trends and deliver a **predictive model** that can help optimize energy consumption for households.
